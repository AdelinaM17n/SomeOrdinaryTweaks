## What the hell is this directory?   
This is directory where bunch of jar files will be stored so loom can remap them and add them as a dependency. Most of those jar files will mods I mixin in for compatibility.
## Why is it empty then?
I do not intend redistribute these mods, even if I wanted to do license issues will bite me.
### Current list of mods needed here for the project to build
*Nothing*
